# Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions
#
# Enables keyless authentication from GitHub Actions to GCP.
# This is more secure than using service account keys.
#
# NOTE: Both skane-trails-checker and meal-planner share the same GCP project.
# Each repo gets its OWN WIF pool to keep infrastructure fully independent.
# If one repo removes its pool, the other is unaffected.
