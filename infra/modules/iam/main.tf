# IAM Module - Grant permissions to users
#
# This module assigns custom IAM roles to users for accessing the Skåne Trails Checker project.
# All personal user emails should be defined in environments/dev/access/users.txt
#
# Custom roles defined in custom_roles.tf:
# 1. Infrastructure Manager - Create/manage infrastructure (can be revoked after setup)
# 2. App User - Runtime data access (permanent)

# Project-level IAM bindings for users
